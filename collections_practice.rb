#Build a method sort_array_desc that takes in an array of integers and returns a copy of the array with the integers in descending order. Remember that .sort takes a block in which you can specify how you want your array sorted.

#Build a method swap_elements that takes in an array and swaps the second and third elements. Remember that array indices start at 0, so the second element has an index of 1 and the third element has an index of 2.

#Build a method called kesha_maker that takes in an array of strings and replaces the third character in each string with a $ ("dollar sign")â€”Ke$ha style. Use the .each method to iterate and build a new array to return at the end of your method, just like we did in the "My Each" lab.

# Build a method find_a that returns all the strings in the array passed to it that start_with? (hint) the letter "a". You'll want to use a high level iterator for this that finds, selects, or detects elements based on a condition.

  array.find_all do |words|
    words.start_with? "a"

#Build a method sum_array that adds together all of the integers in the array and returns their sum.
